Java Script-Based Mobile Web Digital Audio Workstation
=================
Hello, this is my project for my bachelor thesis at University Regensburg.

Built on top of naomiaro's[waveform-playlist](https://github.com/naomiaro/waveform-playlist). A Multitrack Web Audio editor and player with canvas waveform preview.
The project got extended for mobile use via Mouse Touch-Events and a different User Interface - built with Bootstrap.
